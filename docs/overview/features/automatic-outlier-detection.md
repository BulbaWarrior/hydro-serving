# Automatic Outlier Detection

Hydrosphere Monitoring includes monitoring every request going through your platform. Every request is analyzed by an automatically generated based on training data provided outlier detection model.

You can observe those models deployed as metrics in your monitoring dashboard. These metrics provide you with information about how novel/anomalous your data is.

If these values of this metric deviate significantly from the average, you can tell that you experience a data drift and need to re-evaluate your ML pipeline to check for errors.
