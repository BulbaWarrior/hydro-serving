# Tutorials

This section contains tutorials to help you get started with the Hydrosphere platform. A tutorial shows how to accomplish a goal rather than a single basic task. 

### Tutorials 

* [A/B Deployment and Traffic Shadowing](https://hydrosphere.gitbook.io/home/tutorials/a-b-analysis-for-a-recommendation-model)
* [Using Deployment Configurations](https://hydrosphere.gitbook.io/home/tutorials/deployment-configuration)
* [Train & Deploy Census Income Classification Model](https://hydrosphere.gitbook.io/home/tutorials/train-and-deploy-census-income-classification-model)
* [Monitor Anomalies with a Custom Metric](https://hydrosphere.gitbook.io/home/tutorials/custom_metric)
* [Monitor External Models](https://hydrosphere.gitbook.io/home/tutorials/monitoring-external-models) 

Typically, a tutorial has several sections. When a tutorial section has several pieces of code to illustrate it, they are sometimes shown as a group of tabs that you can switch between.
