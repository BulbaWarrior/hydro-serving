# Model Registry

Hydrosphere has an internal Model Registry as centralized storage for Model Versions. When you build a Dockerized model and upload it to Hydrosphere or create new model versions, they get uploaded/stored to the configured model registry in the form of images. This organizes and simplifies model management across the platform and production lifecycle.
