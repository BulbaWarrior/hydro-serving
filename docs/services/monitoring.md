# Monitoring



{% hint style="info" %}
Hydrosphere Monitoring is not available as an open-source solution. If you are interested in this component you can contact us via [gitter](https://gitter.im/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving) or our [website](https://hydrosphere.io)

## Automatic Outlier Detection

Hydrosphere Monitoring includes monitoring every request going through your platform. Every request is analyzed by an automatically generated based on training data provided outlier detection model.

You can observe those models deployed as metrics in your monitoring dashboard. These metrics provide you with information about how novel/anomalous your data is.

If these values of this metric deviate significantly from the average, you can tell that you experience a data drift and need to re-evaluate your ML pipeline to check for errors.

## Sonar

Sonar service is responsible for managing metrics, training and production data storage, calculating profiles, and shadowing data to the Model Versions which are used as an outlier detection metrics.

## Drift Report



Drift Report service creates a statistical report based on a comparison of training and production data distributions. It compares these two sets of data by a set of statistical tests and finds deviations.

Drift report uses multiple different tests with p=.95 for different features:

**Numerical** features:

* Levene's test with a trimmed mean 
* Welch's t-test
* Mood's test
* Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test

**Categorical** features:

* Chi-Square test
* Unseen categories
