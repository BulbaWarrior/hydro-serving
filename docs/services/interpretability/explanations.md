Explanations service **generates explanations for a particular model prediction to help you understand 
the outcome** by telling why your model made this prediction. 

Depending on the type of data your model uses, Root Cause provides an explanation as either
a set of logical predicates if your  data is in a tabular format or a saliency map
if your data is in the image format. Saliency Map is a heat map that highlights parts of
a picture that a prediction was based on.
