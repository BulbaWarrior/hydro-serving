Hydrosphere is a platform for deploying, versioning and monitoring your machine learning models in production. If you need to check how your model is performing on production data, then Hydrosphere is for you. 

## Features

- **Containerized**. Hydrosphere is built on Docker and Kubernetes. You can run any language or library you need on any cloud provider or on premises.
- **Model Quality Monitoring**. Hydrosphere checks your production data stream to hold the same properties as your training data, so your offline metrics would match your online metrics.
-  **Root Cause Analytics**. If model degradation happens and your metrics decline, Hydrosphere will report you which data had caused it.
- **Novel Data Export**. Hydrosphere analyses your production data for novelty and allows you to export novel data for further analysis.
- **Model Version Control**. Hydrosphere version controls your models and pipelines as they are deployed. You can explore how metrics change, roll-back to a previous version and more.


## Getting Started

You can launch Hydrosphere with [Docker](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/install/docker.html) or [Kubernetes](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/install/kubernetes.html)
