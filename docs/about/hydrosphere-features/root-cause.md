# Root Cause Analysis

Root Cause analysis is designed to help Hydrosphere users understand the underlying causes of changes in predictions coming from their models.  

The Root Cause service generates explanations of predictions produced by your models and tells you why a model made a particular prediction. Depending on the type of data your model uses, Root Cause provides an explanation as either a set of logical predicates \(if your data is in a tabular format\) or a saliency map \(if your data is in the image format\). Saliency Map is a heat map that highlights parts of a picture that a prediction was based on.
