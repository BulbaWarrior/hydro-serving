Hydrosphere Serving is a cluster for deploying and versioning your machine learning models in production.

* **Framework Agnostic**. Serve machine learning models developed in any language or framework. Hydrosphere Serving will wrap them in a Docker image and deploy on your production cluster, exposing HTTP, gRPC and Kafka interfaces.
* **Traffic shadowing**. Shadow your traffic between different model versions to examine how different model versions behave on the same traffic.
* **Model Version Control**. Version control your models and pipelines as they are deployed.
