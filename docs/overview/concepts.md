  There are a few concepts that you should be familiar with before starting to
  work with the Hydrosphere platform.

# Concepts

## Models & Model Versions

A **Model** is a machine learning model or a processing function that consumes provided inputs and produces predictions or transformations.

Within the Hydrosphere platform, we break down the model to its versions. Each **Model version** represents a single Docker image containing all the artifacts that you have uploaded to the platform. Consequently, **Model** is a group of **Model versions** with the same name.

## Runtimes

A **Runtime** is a docker image with the predefined gRPC interface which loads and serves your model.

We have [implemented](../reference/runtimes.md) a few runtimes, which you can use in your own projects.

## Servable

**Servable** is a deployed instance of a Model version combined with a Runtime. It exposes a gRPC endpoint that can be used to send requests.

User should not use Servable as-is, since it's are designed to be a building block, rather than inference endpoint. We provide a better alternative to deploy a Model version â€” Application.

## Applications

An **Application** is a pipeline of Servables.

When a user creates Application, Manager service automatically deploys appropriate Servables. The Application handles monitoring of your models and is able to perform A/B traffic split.

Servable can't do that. Don't deploy Servables unless you know what you are doing.

For each Application, there are publicly available HTTP and gRPC endpoints that you can send requests to.

## Deployment Configurations

A **Deployment Configuration** is a collection of Kubernetes settings that you can set for your Servables and Model Versions used in stages of Applications.

Deployment Configuration covers:

* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler specs
* Container Specs 
  * Resource requirements - limits and requests 
* Pod Specs
  * Node Selectors
  * Affinity
  * Tolerations
* Deployment Specs
  * Replicas count

## Resource definitions

**Resource definitions** describe Models, Applications, and Deployment Configurations in a YAML format. You can learn more about them in the [How to write resource definitions](../how-to/write-definitions.md) section.

## Metrics

Data coming through deployed Model Versions can be monitored with metrics.

**Metric** is a Model Version that takes a combination of inputs & outputs from another monitored Model Version, receives every request and response from the monitored model, produces a single value, and compares it with a threshold to determine whether this request was healthy or not.

Every request is evaluated against all metrics assigned to the model.

## Checks

A **check** is a boolean condition associated with a field of a Model Version signature which shows for every request whether field value is acceptable or not.

e.g. Min/Max checks ensure that field value is in an acceptable range which is inferred from training data values.

## Model's Signature

A **Model's** **Signature** is a specification of your model computation which identifies the name of a function with its inputs and outputs, including their names, shapes, and data types.

e.g. signature defined in a YAML file:

```yaml
contract:
  name: predict
  inputs:
    x:
      shape: [-1, 2]
      type: double
      profile: numerical
  outputs:
    y:
      shape: scalar
      type: int
      profile: categorical
```

## Field

A **Field** is a basic element of a Model's signature. It has name, shape, data type, and profile.

e.g. model's signature field defined in a YAML file:

```yaml
x:
  shape: [-1, 2]
  type: double
  profile: numerical
```

## Field\`s Profile

A **Profile** is a special tag that tells how Hydrosphere should interpret the field's data.

There are multiple available tags: Numerical, Categorical, Image, Text, Audio, Video, etc.
