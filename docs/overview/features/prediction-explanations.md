# Prediction Explanations

Explanations service **generates explanations for a particular model prediction to help you understand the outcome** by telling why your model made this prediction.

Depending on the type of data your model uses, Root Cause provides an explanation as either a set of logical predicates if your data is in a tabular format or a saliency map if your data is in the image format. Saliency Map is a heat map that highlights parts of a picture that a prediction was based on.
